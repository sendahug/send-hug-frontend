## Bugs

### Found a bug?

- **Found a bug?** You can start by searching for it in our repo's open [issues](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/issues).
- **Haven't found a bug report?** Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Be sure to include as much information about the bug itself, the behaviour you expected, the circumstances around the appearance of this bug, and anything else that's relevant to your bug report.

### Before you work on a fix

Before you start working on a bug fix, make sure that there's no currently open pull request with a fix for the same bug. If there is, consider joining the existing PR rather than creating you own. If there isn't, feel free to start working on your own fix and open a PR when you're ready!

### Submitting a PR

Pull requests are welcome in this project. When submitting a bug-related PR, make sure to:

- Include a link to the issue, if your PR is a fix for a reported bug (from our repo's open issues).
- Include information about the bug itself, the behaviour you expected, the circumstances around the appearance of this bug, how you fixed it, and any other relevant data in the PR description.
- Give the PR an informative title (guidance below).
- Add a changelog entry (see guidance [here](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/blob/dev/changelog/README.md)).

Also, make sure that your code:

- Is properly documented.
- Is concise and solves the bug.
- Follows the same styling as the project.
- Clears all checks (particularly the tests).

## New Features

### Suggest a feature

- **Want to suggest a new feature?** You can start by searching for a similar feature in our repo's open [issues](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/issues).
- **Found a similar feature already suggested?** Feel free to join the conversation and make your own suggestions for adaptations or changes.
- **Didn't find a similar feature?** No problem. You can [open a feature request](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=). Be sure to include as much information as you can, including a description of the feature and any ideas you have for its implementation (if any). Be as descriptive as possible.

### Before you work on a PR

Before you start working on your own implementation of a new feature, check our open pull requests and look for similar ideas. If there are, consider joining the existing pull request. Found a similar idea in our closed pull requests? Check why before opening a new PR.

If there aren't, make sure a similar feature wasn't already implemented in our [Dev branch](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/tree/Dev). The currently deployed version is the stable [master branch](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/tree/master) version; features aren't added directly to it, but to the development branch. Just because the feature doesn't exist in the deployed version doesn't mean it's not in the works.

Haven't found a reference to it anywhere? Feel free to start working on your own implementation and open a PR when you're ready!

### Submitting a PR

Pull requests are welcome in this project. When submitting a feature-related PR, make sure to:

- Include a link to the feature request, if your PR is meant to close an open feature request.
- Include information about the feature, how you implemented it, and any other relevant data in the PR description.
- Include the relevant tests for your feature. This is just as essential as the feature itself.
- Give the PR an informative title (guidance below).
- Add a changelog entry (see guidance [here](https://github.com/sendahug/send-hug-frontend/blob/dev/changelog/README.md)).

Also, make sure that your code:

- Is properly documented.
- Is concise and solves the bug.
- Follows the same styling as the project.
- Clears all checks (particularly the tests).

## Pull Request Title

The title of the pull request must contain a brief description of the main change, and be prefixed with one of the following, depending on the type of change included:

- `feature:` - For new features.
- `change:` - For any changes to existing functionality in the app.
- `fix:` - For any bug fixes.
- `chore:` - For dependency updates, CI/CD, repository files (e.g., contributing.md), build/deployment-related files and general code cleanup.
- `docs:` - For any updates to the dodcumentation.

Note that there's also a `deps:` prefix, but it's reserved to Dependabot's pull requests.
