## Dependencies

### Gulp

The site uses several tools to maximise compatibility:

1. **Gulp** - Gulp enables running tasks automatically. You can read more on the [Gulp website](https://gulpjs.com). Gulp is a Node.js tool, so it requires installing Node.
2. **Gulp-Postcss** with **Autoprefixer** Plugin - A Gulp plugin which adds the necessary browser prefixes to the CSS file. For more info check the [Gulp-postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-postcss) page and the [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) page on NPM.
3. **Browserify** (with vinyl-source-stream and vinyl-buffer) - A library for bundling modular code. Browserify bundles up the main module (AppModule) and converts it from TypeScript to ES6. For more info, check the [Browserify repo](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) and Gulp's [Browserify + Gulp recipe](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/browserify-uglify-sourcemap.md).
4. **Gulp-Babel** - A Gulp plugin for the transpiler Babel. Converts Browserify's ES6 output to the highly supported ES5. For more info check the plugin's [GitHub](https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel) repository.
5. **Gulp-Uglify** - A Gulp plugin which minimises the single ES5 file (Babel's output). For more info check the [Gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) page on NPM.
6. **Gulp-Sourcemaps** - A Gulp plugin utilizing the source maps tool. For more info check the [Gulp-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) page on NPM.
7. **Gulp-Rename** - A gulp plugin used to rename files. Used to rename the main module JS and to change the directory name of all HTML files. For more info check the [Gulp-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename) page on NPM.
8. **Gulp-replace** - A string replace plugin for Gulp. Used to change the templateUrls in the final JS file. For more info, check the [Gulp-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-replace) page on NPM.
9. **Gulp-Jasmine-Browser** - A headless browser extension for the unit-testing tool Jasmine. The site also includes **Jasmine-core** and **Puppeteer** in order to execute Jasmine tests from the command line. For more info check the [Gulp-jasmine-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jasmine-browser) page on NPM or the [Jasmine documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/) page.

### Angular

1. **@angular/animations** - Angular's animations library.
2. **@angular/common** - Angular's commonly needed services, pipes and directives.
3. **@angular/compiler** - Angular's template compiler.
4. **@angular/compiler-cli** - Command-line interface to invoke Angular's compiler.
5. **@angular/core** - Critical runtime parts of the Angular framework.
6. **@angular/forms** - Support for template-driven and reactive forms.
7. **@angular/platform-browser** - Everything DOM and browser-related.
8. **@angular/platform-browser-dynamic** - Providers and methods for compiling and running the app.
9. **@angular/router** - Angular's router module.
10. **rxjs** - Contains an implementation of observables, which many Angular APIs use.
11. **typescript** - TypeScript language server, which Angular uses.
12. **zone.js** - Implementation of zones for JavaScript (used by Angular).
13. **core-js** - Modular standard library for JavaScript. Contains polyfills. For more information, check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

For more information about Angular's required NPM packages, check the [Angular docs](https://angular.io/guide/npm-packages).

## Authentication

The project uses Auth0 as a third-party authentication provider. Authentication is done by Auth0, which in turn returns a JSON Web Token containing the user's data and permissions.

While the frontend decodes and uses the JWT, it doesn't verify the given token. This is done by the backend. Upon login, a request is made to the server to fetch the user's data. Since getting user's data requires authentication, if the server's response contains the user's data, the frontend can treat the token as valid. Once the token is verified, the user is marked as 'authenticated'.

On top of fetching the user's data, the frontend also deals with login, logout, hash parsing and token refreshing. These are done using [Auth0-js](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0js/v9), Auth0's client-side library. All authentication handling in the frontend is done by the [AuthService](./src/app/services/auth.service.ts).

The frontend Authentication Process:

1. Once the user logs in, Auth0-js parses the URL hash in order to extract the JWT.

2. The token is then decoded and its payload is passed on.

3. An attempt is made to fetch the user's data from the backend, where the token is verified. If successful, the fetched data is used as the user's data and the user is marked as authenticated.

4. The verified token is added to localStorage, in order to be used later on.

5. Upon logout, the frontend clears all user data, including the saved JWT.

Notes:

  - If the user doesn't exist in the database (the request was rejected because of something other than an AuthError), that means it's a new user. AuthService then makes a request to the server to add the new user to the database.
  - If the user isn't redirected to the app from Auth0, there's no JWT in the URL. In that case, AuthService fetches the JWT from localStorage. If the JWT is still valid, AuthService attempts to refresh it while fetching the user's data. This lets the users stay logged in for longer periods of time without forcing them to actively login again.
