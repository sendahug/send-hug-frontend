      "description": "Converted the validation functions in the Validation Service to the 'Angular form validators' format. This way, instead of running form validation and then running our validator separately, we run our validator as part of Angular's form validation. This also clears out the unnecessary manual adjustments we made to form inputs' classes, as the invalid indicator now relies entirely on Angular's form validation."

      "description": "Moved the alert generation (for invalid form submission) from the validation service to the form components. This makes the validation service's purpose more specific and cleaner - it only validates the inputs, instead of validating and alerting the user. It's now the form components' responsibility to handle validation errors, as it should've been in the first place."

      "description": "The report form's 'submit' button is no longer disabled if a reason isn't selected. Instead, if the users click it, an error message is shown to let them know a report reason is required. This makes the user experience better and less frustrating, as the button is no longer disabled without any explanation."
