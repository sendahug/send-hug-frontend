Now, instead of the popup containing all the forms and passing the data to them from the parent component, the popup contains a slot, which is then populated by the various forms. The forms are then added to the parent components themselves and get their data directly from the parent components, instead of it having to be passed through the popup. The new popup component is responsible only for the general styling and for trapping the focus within the modal."
