Previously, when the form was submitted, the PostEditForm triggered the ItemsService or the AdminService to update the back-end with the edited post. Now, the PostEditForm uses the APIClient to make the request to edit the post in either case. If the form was triggered from the admin dashboard and the user chose to close the report, that request is sent to the AdminService separately."
