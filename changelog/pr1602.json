      "description": "Simplified the inputs to the Display Name Edit Form. Previously, the form relied on a separate input to indicate whether it should fetch the name to edit from the Auth Service or from the form input (which was a string). This was unnecessarily complicated. Now, both the Admin Reports screen and the User page screen pass in an object that contains the ID and name of the user to edit. When the form is submitted, the ID of the user is compared to the ID of the currently logged in user (in the Auth Service). If it's the same, the request is made via the auth service; otherwise, it's made via the Admin Service."

      "change": "Fixes",
      "description": "Added missing calls to `subscribe` in Admin Service methods that call the `closeReport` method. Since the method returns a cold observable, those `closeReport` requests weren't executed until a subscription was made to the observable, which means reports weren't closed in those workflows."
