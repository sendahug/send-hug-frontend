      "description": "Fixed a bug where the sitemap hid the admin routes when users refreshed the page, even if they had permission to view it. This happened as a result of the re-authentication process (which runs automatically when the page is refreshed) took longer than it took to set up the component and the sitemap was only built when the component was set up. Now, if the user isn't authenticated 'yet', the component shows the unauthenticated routes but subscribes to the subject indicating whether the user is authenticated, and once they're authenticated, the component rebuilds the list of available paths."
