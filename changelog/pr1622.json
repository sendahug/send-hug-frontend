      "description": "Moved the posts' ARIA descriptions to the Post component. This ensures that all elements are correctly described/labelled for assistive technology and that users don't get conflicted descriptions due to the same IDs being used twice (once in the AppComponent and once in other views that didn't include posts)."

      "description": "Replaced the post template in the MyPosts component with the SinglePost component instead. This means that all post-related functionality is now contained in the SinglePost component and isn't repeated anywhere else. As such, the post-related methods in the MyPosts component were deleted."

      "description": "Changed the way the post's buttons are handled. Previously, the report and message buttons were shown only to authenticated users, and the edit and delete buttons were shown only to moderators and admins. Now, the message and report buttons are shown to all users but are disabled if the user isn't authenticated, and the edit and delete buttons are shown if the user can edit and delete the post (i.e., if they're moderator/admin or if it's their own post)."
