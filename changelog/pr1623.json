      "description": "Simplified the process for updating the logged-in user's data (via the AuthService). Previously, the various components and services updated the AuthService's `userData` manually before making the request to the back-end via the AuthService's update method. Now, those components and services pass an object with the relevant updated properties (e.g., the new display name in the display name edit form) to the AuthService, which updates the `userData` and then makes the request to update the back-end."

      "description": "Fixed a bug where a logged in user's login count was incremented when they updated their display name or icon because the method for updating user data was written with the assumption it'll only be used to update a user's login count."
