Previously, notifications didn't have an individual status, and the new notifications was simply a count of all notifications since the user's last non-silent refresh. Now, each notification has its own individual status, which is shown in the notifications' tab. The new notifications count is returned by the back-end and reflects the number of notifications that haven't been marked 'read'."
