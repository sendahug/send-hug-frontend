The previous icon (times) was used for exit buttons, which made it confusing when it was used differently in the post component. The new icon clarifies the button is for deleting posts, rather than for closing the post component's menu."

      "description": "Added Angular Builder plugins for substituting the free icons and relevant SVGs with the Font Awesome Pro icons (custom or Pro variants). The plugins replace the icons at build time if the Font Awesome kit is installed; if not, the default icons and SVGs are provided. This allows users without a license to still work on the app (which is still open source), regardless of its design."
